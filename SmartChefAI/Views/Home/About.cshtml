        <h1>SmartChefAI helps people plan healthier meals without the stress.</h1>
        <p class="lead mb-0">
            The project started as a coursework assignment but quickly evolved into a platform
            that blends cooking ideas, a calorie tracker, and real AI integrations.

                    We combine your available ingredients with nutrition goals and use Gemini
                    to suggest a balanced meal with clear cooking steps. When you are offline,
                    Dummy AI fills the gap with sample recipes and simulated macros.

                    The project is maintained by a small group of developers and food lovers
                    who believe technology can make healthy eating more approachable.
                    Our next step is AI vision—snap a photo of your plate and SmartChef
                    will generate the recipe and macros.
